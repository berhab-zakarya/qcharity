                <p>As the conflict in Sudan enters its third year on April 15, 2025, Qatar Charity continues to expand its humanitarian response. Over the past two years, the organization has delivered more than <strong>5,600 tons of humanitarian aid</strong>, reaching approximately <strong>1.75 million internally displaced people (IDPs) and conflict-affected individuals</strong> across safe regions in Sudan.</p>

                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Humanitarian Aid Distribution</strong>: Support provided to around <strong>1.7 million displaced and war-affected individuals</strong>.</li>
                </ul>

                <p style={{marginLeft: ".5in"}}>&nbsp;</p>

                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Critical Health Interventions</strong>: Immediate response initiatives were launched for <strong>patients with kidney failure and cancer</strong>.</li>
                </ul>

                <p style={{marginLeft: ".5in"}}>&nbsp;</p>

                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Ongoing Food Assistance</strong>: Continued distribution of food baskets to <strong>hundreds of thousands of displaced individuals</strong>, supported by the <strong>Qatar Fund for Development (QFFD)</strong>.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Currently, field teams are active in multiple states, distributing <strong>2,500 food baskets</strong> and <strong>230 tons of dates</strong>, funded by the <strong>Qatar Fund for Development</strong>, and implemented in partnership with the <strong>Qatar Red Crescent </strong>in Sudan.</p>

                <p style={{marginLeft: ".25in"}}>In the states of <strong>Kassala, Al-Qadarif, and Al-Jazirah</strong>, Qatar Charity is also carrying out a project to provide <strong>hot meals and essential supplies</strong> for displaced people, including 600 kitchen kits.</p>

                <p style={{marginLeft: ".25in"}}>1,500 sleeping mats, 6,000 blankets, 140 underground water tanks, 6,000 women&rsquo;s hygiene kits, 600 tents, 16,500 ready-to-eat meals.</p>

                <p>Additionally, health supplies like dialysis machines, incubators, and cholera medications are being delivered as part of this initiative.</p>

                <p><strong>Strengthening The Healthcare Sector</strong></p>

                <p>The cumulative aid provided by Qatar Charity has now reached <strong>1.75 million people</strong>, including food, medical, and shelter supplies totaling <strong>5,635 tons</strong>. With continued support from the <strong>Qatar Fund for Development</strong>, hundreds of tons of relief supplies were airlifted to Sudan through <strong>three humanitarian air bridges</strong>, delivering <strong>food, medicine, medical equipment</strong>, and <strong>shelter materials</strong> to those most in need.</p>

                <p><strong>Advancing Health Care </strong></p>

                <p>These efforts have significantly supported Sudan&rsquo;s collapsing health infrastructure. Qatar Charity took the initiative to <strong>pay salaries of medical staff</strong> at <strong>Al-Nau Hospital in Omdurman</strong>, a vital facility serving patients after the shutdown of hundreds of hospitals in Khartoum.</p>

                <p>It also launched a <strong>mobile clinic project</strong> providing <strong>free medical care and medicine</strong> to refugees in Port Sudan, responding to the outbreak of infectious diseases in camps. The clinic operated for a full month, covering multiple camps and displacement areas.</p>

                <p><strong>Advancing Food security </strong></p>

                <p>In the early months of the crisis, Qatar Charity rapidly responded by delivering <strong>125,000 hot meals</strong> to displaced individuals at shelters in <strong>Port Sudan</strong> and the <strong>Arqin border crossing</strong> with Egypt. It has since continued distributing <strong>hot meals and food baskets</strong> across various states, delivering <strong>90,000 baskets</strong> to affected families.</p>

                <p>In 2024 alone, with QFFD funding, Qatar Charity rolled out <strong>its largest food security project to date</strong> in war-affected areas, distributing <strong>50,000 food baskets</strong>.</p>

                <p>With Sudan&rsquo;s stock of life-saving medicines for cancer and kidney failure patients nearing depletion, the <strong>Ministry of Health</strong> issued an urgent appeal. Qatar Charity responded immediately, establishing an air bridge to deliver <strong>62 tons of critical medications</strong>, aiding approximately <strong>8,000 patients</strong>.</p>

                <p>It ensured the continuation of dialysis services and kidney transplants by providing essential medication and medical supplies, enabling <strong>52,000 dialysis sessions</strong>. When further shortages arose, Qatar Charity provided <strong>medical consumables, blood bags, and IV fluids</strong>, much of which was used in <strong>cholera isolation centers</strong> in <strong>Wad Madani</strong> and other war-affected hospitals.</p>

                <p><strong>Enhancing Living Conditions in Displacement Camps</strong></p>

                <p>Qatar Charity prioritized <strong>safe drinking water</strong>, <strong>sanitation</strong>, and <strong>environmental health tools</strong> for displaced people in shelters. In <strong>Kassala</strong>, it improved the living conditions of IDPs by rehabilitating <strong>health facilities</strong>, providing <strong>medical supplies</strong>, and conducting <strong>environmental hygiene campaigns</strong> to combat disease vectors.</p>

                <p>Additionally, Qatar Charity enabled the <strong>resumption of schooling</strong> by launching a <strong>Safe Return to School</strong> project, which included <strong>relocating displaced individuals from schools</strong> in <strong>Port Sudan</strong>, allowing educational activities to restart.</p>
